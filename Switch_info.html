	<h2>Progression of the game :</h2>
	<p><b><u>By the first defense</u></b></p>
	<p class = "journal">The project is moving along on schedule, our expectations have been met and we are set to reach
our goals for next defense within the given time.</p>
	<img src="./img/1st_defense_obj_table.png" height="150px" "alt="1st defense objectives table"></img>
	<p class = "journal">Interface and AI are still at a rudimentary level, as was scheduled in the book of specifications,
as they require some of the elementary assets developed during the first phase of the project. In
the case of interface, the first game scenes must be put together before we can link them together
while monster AI requires functioning players to track.
<br>The development of elementary assets is progressing ahead of schedule : graphics, multiplayer
connectivity and the game’s physics are all going smoothly, which means a solid base is in place to
start working on the more intricate parts of the project.
<br>Music and website making are also going according to schedule.</p>

	<p class = "journal">As for the next step of the project, the focus is still on the creation of the assets to be used in the
construction of the game later. However, now that the base of the game is in place, the
development of assets depending on other parts of the game, such as AI, can start being introduced.
<br>Currently, we are mostly working on separate parts of the project with little overlap, which is
why, for the next defense, we plan to start gathering all parts of the project into one. Once we have
a coherent, playable game, we can focus on expanding on it and improving the existing content.
</p>
<p><b><u>By the second defense</u></b></p>
<p class="journal">Our team has had to work from home, so we did not merge the different elements of the game. However, staying at home did not slow us down whatsoever
and we were once again able to reach our objectives.</p>
<img src="./img/2nd_defense_obj_table.png" height="150px" "alt="2nd defense objectives table"></img>
<p class="journal">Most of what the multiplayer has to accomplish for this project has been done. Finer details
have been further worked on in order to improve the player’s experience. Packet loss handling
(synchronization of data), server authority and custom properties over the network have all been
added. As predicted the multiplayer is only missing very few additions such as managing ownerships, animator view and a scoreboard.
<br>A new interface has been added to the game. Once a player has loaded a scene and is in a level,
they are able to press escape to either leave the session they are in, or resume the game they are
playing. Leaving the session will get you back to the lobby selection screen and the player will be
able to join another room.
<br>As for music, Switch now has in total four original soundtracks split evenly between worlds, 2 for the Candyland,
1 for the Squalidland and the last one for the menu.<br>
Many new 3D models have been created : more monsters and decorations for both worlds, as well as models to use as a basis for the player design.
A few levels have already been made.
More level making, as well as modeling and animating more monsters and player design, is what awaits the Blender team.
<br>Many features have been added to the game, such as player state, possession, interactive objects and level generation.
<br> Finally, all of the website's subpages were created and will be completed after the second defense and right before the last one.</p>
